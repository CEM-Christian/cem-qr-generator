# Auto-Organization Detection Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Overview
Successfully implemented auto-organization detection for the CEM QR Generator that automatically matches destination URLs against predefined patterns to populate the organization field and set QR code logos during new link creation.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- ✅ Extended `OrganizationConfig` interface with `urlPatterns` property
- ✅ Added URL patterns for ACC organizations (acc, acc-moreton, acc-southlands)
- ✅ Created comprehensive URL pattern matching utility (`app/utils/url-matcher.ts`)
- ✅ Implemented domain/path matching with specificity scoring
- ✅ Added proper error handling and edge case management

### Phase 2: Auto-Detection Integration
- ✅ Built organization detection composable (`app/composables/useOrganizationDetection.ts`)
- ✅ Added debouncing for improved performance
- ✅ Implemented manual override support
- ✅ Created logo auto-selection capabilities
- ✅ Added organization-to-logo ID mapping functionality

### Phase 3: Enhanced Link Creation Form Integration
- ✅ Modified `Editor.vue` to integrate auto-detection
- ✅ Added custom URL field template with blur event handler
- ✅ Set up organization field auto-population
- ✅ Implemented manual override detection
- ✅ Added proper form validation integration

### Phase 4: Logo Auto-Selection
- ✅ Enhanced auto-detection to include QR logo selection
- ✅ Mapped organization IDs to corresponding logo IDs
- ✅ Integrated with existing QR Style Editor logo selection system
- ✅ Added logo auto-selection to the detection workflow

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### URL Pattern Matching (`app/utils/url-matcher.ts`)
- **Domain Matching**: Handles www prefix normalization, case-insensitive matching
- **Path Matching**: Supports prefix matching with specificity scoring
- **Specificity Calculation**: Longer path matches get higher priority
- **Organization Mapping**: Returns organization ID for best match

### Auto-Detection Composable (`app/composables/useOrganizationDetection.ts`)
- **Debounced Processing**: 300ms delay for optimal UX
- **Manual Override**: Tracks when user manually changes organization
- **Logo Integration**: Automatically maps organization to logo selection
- **State Management**: Reactive properties for detection status

### Form Integration (`app/components/dashboard/links/Editor.vue`)
- **URL Blur Handler**: Triggers detection when user leaves URL field
- **Auto-Population**: Sets organization field automatically
- **Manual Override Detection**: Tracks user changes to organization field
- **Logo Auto-Selection**: Updates QR logo when organization is detected

## 🎨 User Experience

### Automatic Detection Flow
1. User enters URL in the link creation form
2. On blur (when leaving the URL field), auto-detection runs
3. If organization is detected, field is auto-populated
4. QR logo is automatically selected to match organization
5. User can manually override the detected organization

### Manual Override Support
- User can change organization selection after auto-detection
- System remembers manual override and won't auto-detect again
- Clear indication when organization was auto-detected vs manually set

## 📊 URL Pattern Coverage

### Australian Christian College (ACC)
- **Main Organization** (`acc`): `acc.edu.au`, `www.acc.edu.au`
- **ACC Moreton** (`acc-moreton`): `/moreton/` paths on ACC domains
- **ACC Southlands** (`acc-southlands`): `/southlands/` paths on ACC domains

### Pattern Specificity
- Domain-only matches: Base score of 100
- Domain + path matches: Base score of 100 + (path length × 10)
- Most specific match wins (longest path match)

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

### Test Cases Created
- ✅ ACC main domain detection
- ✅ ACC subdomain handling
- ✅ ACC Moreton specific path detection
- ✅ ACC Southlands specific path detection
- ✅ Non-matching URL handling
- ✅ Invalid URL error handling

### Test Infrastructure
- Created comprehensive test page (`/test-url-matching`)
- Automated test case runner with pass/fail indicators
- Manual URL testing interface for development
- Integration with development server for real-time testing

## 🔮 Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Additional Organizations
- Easy to add more organizations by extending URL patterns
- Support for more complex matching rules (regex patterns)
- Domain aliases and redirect handling

### Enhanced Detection
- Machine learning-based pattern recognition
- Historical data analysis for pattern improvement
- User feedback integration for pattern refinement

### UX Improvements
- Visual indicators for auto-detection
- Confidence scoring display
- Bulk organization assignment for existing links
