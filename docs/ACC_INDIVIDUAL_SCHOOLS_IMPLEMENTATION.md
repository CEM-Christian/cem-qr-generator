# ACC Individual Schools Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Implementation Completed

This document summarizes the successful implementation of individual ACC (Australian Christian College) schools as separate organizations in the CEM QR Generator system, with hierarchical filtering functionality.

## üìã Changes Made

### 1. Schema Updates (`schemas/organization.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Added 11 new ACC school organization IDs
- ‚úÖ Updated `OrganizationSchema` enum with all new schools
- ‚úÖ Updated `ORGANIZATION_IDS` array
- ‚úÖ Maintained backwards compatibility with existing `acc` organization

**New Organization IDs Added:**
- `acc-moreton` (ACC Moreton)
- `acc-singleton` (ACC Singleton)
- `acc-marsdenpark` (ACC Marsden Park)
- `acc-echuca` (ACC Echuca)
- `acc-benalla` (ACC Benalla)
- `acc-casey` (ACC Casey)
- `acc-darlingdowns` (ACC Darling Downs)
- `acc-southlands` (ACC Southlands)
- `acc-burnie` (ACC Burnie)
- `acc-launceston` (ACC Launceston)
- `acc-hobart` (ACC Hobart)

### 2. Organization Configuration (`app/config/organizations.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Added complete configurations for all 11 ACC schools
- ‚úÖ Used consistent `acc.svg` logo for all ACC organizations
- ‚úÖ Applied ACC brand color (`#059669`) across all schools
- ‚úÖ Generated unique initials for each school (e.g., ACC-M, ACC-S, ACC-MP)
- ‚úÖ Fixed property key quoting for ESLint compliance

### 3. Hierarchical Filtering Logic (`app/composables/useOrganizations.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Added `isAccOrganization()` function to identify ACC-related organizations
- ‚úÖ Added `getAccOrganizations()` function to retrieve all ACC organization IDs
- ‚úÖ Added `getFilteredOrganizations()` function for hierarchical filtering
- ‚úÖ Maintained all existing functionality

### 4. Dashboard Integration (`app/components/dashboard/links/Index.vue`)
- ‚úÖ Updated filtering logic to use hierarchical filtering
- ‚úÖ Preserved existing URL parameter persistence
- ‚úÖ Maintained backwards compatibility

## üéØ Hierarchical Filtering Behavior

### Parent Organization Filtering
When users select the main **"Australian Christian College"** organization:
- ‚úÖ System includes all 12 ACC organizations (parent + 11 schools)
- ‚úÖ Displays links from any ACC school in the filtered results
- ‚úÖ Provides unified view of all ACC-related content

### Individual School Filtering
When users select a specific ACC school (e.g., "ACC Singleton"):
- ‚úÖ System filters to show only that specific school's links
- ‚úÖ Maintains granular control for school-specific content
- ‚úÖ Preserves existing single-organization filtering behavior

### Non-ACC Organization Filtering
When users select non-ACC organizations:
- ‚úÖ System maintains existing single-organization filtering
- ‚úÖ No changes to existing filtering behavior
- ‚úÖ Full backwards compatibility preserved

## üîç Technical Validation

### Schema Compliance
- ‚úÖ All new organization IDs follow naming convention (concatenated place names)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful
- ‚úÖ Zod schema validation working correctly
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing types

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ ESLint compliance achieved (consistent property quoting)
- ‚úÖ Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- ‚úÖ Proper TypeScript type inference maintained
- ‚úÖ Auto-imports working correctly

### Functionality Testing
- ‚úÖ Hierarchical filtering logic tested and verified
- ‚úÖ 12 ACC organizations correctly identified
- ‚úÖ Filtering by "acc" returns all 12 ACC organizations
- ‚úÖ Individual school filtering returns single organization
- ‚úÖ Non-ACC filtering maintains existing behavior

## üìä Organization Mapping

| Organization ID | Display Name | Initials | Logo | Color |
|----------------|--------------|----------|------|-------|
| `acc` | Australian Christian College | ACC | acc.svg | #059669 |
| `acc-moreton` | Australian Christian College Moreton | ACC-M | acc.svg | #059669 |
| `acc-singleton` | Australian Christian College Singleton | ACC-S | acc.svg | #059669 |
| `acc-marsdenpark` | Australian Christian College Marsden Park | ACC-MP | acc.svg | #059669 |
| `acc-echuca` | Australian Christian College Echuca | ACC-E | acc.svg | #059669 |
| `acc-benalla` | Australian Christian College Benalla | ACC-B | acc.svg | #059669 |
| `acc-casey` | Australian Christian College Casey | ACC-C | acc.svg | #059669 |
| `acc-darlingdowns` | Australian Christian College Darling Downs | ACC-DD | acc.svg | #059669 |
| `acc-southlands` | Australian Christian College Southlands | ACC-SL | acc.svg | #059669 |
| `acc-burnie` | Australian Christian College Burnie | ACC-BU | acc.svg | #059669 |
| `acc-launceston` | Australian Christian College Launceston | ACC-L | acc.svg | #059669 |
| `acc-hobart` | Australian Christian College Hobart | ACC-H | acc.svg | #059669 |

## üåç Internationalization
- ‚úÖ All existing translation files already include organization-related keys
- ‚úÖ No additional translation work required
- ‚úÖ UI text properly localized across all supported languages:
  - English (en-US, en-AU)
  - German (de-DE)
  - French (fr-FR)
  - Chinese (zh-CN, zh-TW)
  - Vietnamese (vi-VN)

## üöÄ User Experience

### Enhanced Organization Management
- **Hierarchical View**: Users can filter by main ACC organization to see all schools
- **Granular Control**: Users can filter by specific schools for targeted views
- **Visual Consistency**: All ACC schools share the same logo and brand color
- **Intuitive Interface**: Filtering behavior is logical and user-friendly

### Backwards Compatibility
- **Existing Links**: All existing links continue to work without changes
- **API Compatibility**: No breaking changes to existing endpoints
- **Filter State**: URL parameters and filter persistence unchanged
- **User Workflows**: Existing user workflows remain intact

## üìà Benefits Delivered

1. **Organizational Hierarchy**: Clear parent-child relationship between ACC and individual schools
2. **Unified Branding**: Consistent visual identity across all ACC schools
3. **Flexible Filtering**: Users can view content at both aggregate and individual school levels
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with compile-time validation
5. **Future-Proof**: Architecture supports additional hierarchical organizations
6. **Zero Migration**: No database changes or data migration required

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

The implementation provides a solid foundation for:
- Adding more hierarchical organization relationships
- Implementing organization-specific features and customizations
- Extending filtering capabilities to other organization types
- Adding organization-specific analytics and reporting

## ‚úÖ Requirements Compliance

All requirements from the original PRD have been successfully implemented:

- ‚úÖ **Schema Updates**: 11 new ACC schools added with proper naming
- ‚úÖ **Organization Configuration**: Complete metadata for each school
- ‚úÖ **Hierarchical Filtering**: Parent organization includes all children
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compliance maintained
- ‚úÖ **UI Integration**: All existing selectors include new organizations
- ‚úÖ **Backwards Compatibility**: No breaking changes introduced

**Implementation Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**
**Testing Status**: ‚úÖ **VERIFIED**
**Production Ready**: ‚úÖ **YES**

This implementation successfully delivers the requested ACC individual schools feature with intelligent hierarchical filtering, maintaining system consistency while providing enhanced organizational granularity.
