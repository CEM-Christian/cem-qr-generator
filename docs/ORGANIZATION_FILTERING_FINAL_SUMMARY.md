## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. **Schema Design**
- Used Zod for runtime validation with TypeScript inference
- Made organization field optional for backward compatibility
- Implemented enum-based organization values for type safety

### 2. **Component Architecture**
- Built on Radix Vue for accessible, headless UI components
- Used Select component pattern for consistent UX
- Implemented tooltip integration for enhanced user experience

### 3. **State Management**
- Leveraged Vue 3 Composition API with reactive composables
- Implemented URL parameter persistence for filter state
- Used computed properties for efficient client-side filtering

### 4. **Data Storage**
- Extended Cloudflare KV metadata to include organization
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing links
- Optimized for fast filtering and search operations

### 5. **Internationalization**
- Followed nested key structure for organized translations
- Provided complete organization names in all supported languages
- Used proper i18n patterns with Vue I18n
